While there is no denying that good documentation is a living entity and many a times we have to write documentation for things that are still under development, we sincerely hope our manager did not force the document writer to write the documentation as written by Alice above. With the caveats out of the way, let us get started with helping you use one of the best app testing platforms that has ever walked the surface of the earth - if it could walk.

RobusTest is designed to be a one stop platform for everyone involved in creating a mobile appication - right from business guys who need to see what their application looks like, to developers who need to run some quick checks to testers who need to test the app extensively using manual and automated methods. Some important features of RobusTest are listed below

* Testing on real devices

* Performance-first approach to manual and automated testing

* Simulate real life scenarios for meaningful testing

* Automate your tests and make them data-driven without writing any code

* Run your automated tests on multiple devices in parallel

* In-depth test reports including both funtional and performance test results

* Run your own automated tests on the devices connected to the platform

In this documentation, we will cover all the features of RobusTest. However, some of these features may either be specific to the Enterprise version or available only to paid users of RobusTest public platform. For any questions on the documentation, feel free to write to us at support@robustest.com

Happy reading!

PS: In case you didn't realize the lady's name is Tina not Alice! Happy Testing.
